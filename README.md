## Cleaning Day Map
An interactive map application for exploring the locations of vendor tables in the supposed context of the annual Cleaning Day event (a day when anyone can host a pop-up flea market). The app allows users to add new vendor tables to the map and search for tables by using both a search field and the map window as filters. 

The initial and main objective of the project was to explore and utilize ways of using Mapbox GL maps within a React+Redux app. This is just a demo / proof of concept and not part of the official [Cleaning Day](http://siivouspaiva.com/en/info/basics-of-cleaning-day) event by any means.
